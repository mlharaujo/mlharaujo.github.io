I am currently postdoc at the [Cambridge Logical Structures Hub](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/clash/), a research group which is part of the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I will be here until January 2023, working with [Jamie Vicary](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jv258/) and his group.

I'm interested in Topological Field Theory and related higher algebraic and categorical structures. Recently, I have been using string diagrams to classify higher coherences for duals and adjoints in n-categories, which is related by the Cobordism Hypothesis to the question of finding finite presentations by generators and relations for fully extended bordism categories. 

Until recently, I was a postdoc at the Mathematics Department of Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, in Lisbon. Before that, I did postdocs at the University of Hamburg and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Christohper Douglas](https://www.christopherleedouglas.com/).
