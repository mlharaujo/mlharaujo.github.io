I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Mathematics Department](https://math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/index?lang=en) of Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (University of Lisbon), where I'm also a member of the [Center for Mathematical Analysis, Geometry and Dynamical Systems](https://camgsd.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/index.php?lang=en) and the [Higher Structures and Applications](https://www.fct.pt/apoios/projectos/consulta/vglobal_projecto?idProjecto=152315&idElemConcurso=11763) research project. I am a regular participant in the [TQFT Club](https://tqft.math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) seminar.

I'm interested in Topological Field Theory and related higher algebraic and categorical structures. At the moment I am using string diagrams to classify higher coherences for duals and adjoints in n-categories, which is related by the Cobordim Hypothesis to the question of finding finite presentations by generators and relations for fully extended bordism categories.

From August 2022 to January 2023, I will be a postdoc at the [Cambridge Logical Structures Hub](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/clash/), a research group which is part of the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.
